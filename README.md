Calculating the most similar product according to text and image data

• Deployed CNN in Python using EfficientNet algorithm on image embeddings of ~32k product images and the query image to compute similarity with any query image
• Implemented ArcFace (cross entropy loss) to predict label groups and find near duplicate images; compared price labels for these to ensure customer is presented with the ‘Best Price’
